            MC, uh uh uh
            In the place to be (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
            I know that you been waitin' for it, I'm waitin' too
            In my imagination I be all up on you
            I know you got that fever for me hundred and two
            And boy I know I feel the same my temperature's through the roof
            If it's a camera up in here

            Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
            If it's a camera up in here
            Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
            'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
            I will hunt you down

            'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
            But this is private, between you and I
            Touch my body, put me on the floor
            Wrestle me around, play with me some more
            Touch my body, throw me on the bed
            I just wanna make you feel like you never did
            Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs

            All around your waist, just a little taste
            Touch my body, know you like my curves
            C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body
            Boy you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
            I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
            I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
            And float away with you in a Caribbean sea
            If it's a camera up in here

            Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
            If it's a camera up in here
            Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
            'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
            I will hunt you down
            'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
            But this is private, between you and I

            Touch my body, put me on the floor
            Wrestle me around, play with me some more
            Touch my body, throw me on the bed
            I just wanna make you feel like you never did
            Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
            All around your waist, just a little taste
            Touch my body, know you like my curves
            
            C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body
            I'ma treat you like a teddy bear, you won't wanna go nowhere
            In the lap of luxury, laying intertwined with me
            You won't want for nothing boy (no)
            I will give you plenty of joy

            Touch my body, put me on the floor (put me on the floor)
            Wrestle me around, play with me some more
            Touch my body, throw me on the bed
            I just wanna make you feel like you never did
            Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
            All around your waist, just a little taste
            Touch my body, know you like my curves (I know you like it)
            C'mon and give me what I deserve (Give me what I just said that)
            And touch my body

            Oh yeah oh yeah
            Oh yeah oh yeah
            Yea, yea
            Every little way you like to touch my body, baby
            Yeah, ooh ooh baby

            Ooh, ooh ooh
            (Touch my body)
            C'mon and give me what I deserve
