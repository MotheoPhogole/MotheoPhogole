- ‚ö° Fun fact **The first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer. In the 1840s, she wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine, making her the world's first computer programmer‚Äîover 100 years before the first actual computer was built!
